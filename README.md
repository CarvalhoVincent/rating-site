## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- JavaScript


### What I learned

I learned how to make my 1st project from scratch ! First steps with VS code too. Proud of begining to think in JS.
I coded 5 functions doing the same thing on my first attempt for the rate buttons, cause I didn't found the solution to select buttons 2 to 5 and the result was always return 1.
Finally search on Stackoverflow and found a solution that works to reduce to 1 function for the 5 buttons.



### Continued development

 Still not completely comfortable with responsive.
 The site works fine on my computer on Chrome, Firefox, and Brave, also with my Iphone 13 pro Max and Iphone 12 mini. But seems not optimal on other phones with Chrome, 
 the content of the page is not directly centered and need to be searched by the user... Still haven't found how to fix this.



### Useful resources

- https://www.w3schools.com/ - Use it for some searches and reminders.
- https://stackoverflow.com/ - Use it to solve my problems, and optimize my JS, avoid repeating the same function five times when it can be done with only one function.
